face_test.py
-sample code for face-recognition, outlines facial features of given image

proc_face.py
-given single image outputs csv with processed data points

gen_test_data.py
-given a directory of face images outputs proccessed data points for each

Processed data format:
sample number, facial feature, x:y, x:y, ...

Classified Images (/media/identified_gestures/)
Classes: Smiles, Neutral, Frown, Other

Other - gestures that do not fit into any category or have some object obscuring the face

First pass, good selection of smiles and neutral. May need more frowning samples. Often neutral class can contain some abiguity so should be passed over again.

Processed data points are currently relative to first data point (x0 - x:y0 - y). Some ideas for other point references, center of cluster (k-means), mean point.
Could also repfresent points at distance angle from a mean point (could perhaps identify convex or concave curve of mouth)


# Docker
docker compose can be used to launch the application
There are 2 volumes that are used for the application: input and output
These volumes allow the container to be run for testing without needing to rebuild it

1) Put files you want to analyze in the input folder
2) Run docker-compose up
3) Resulting data.csv file is put in output folder

When code is changed used docker-compose up --build
